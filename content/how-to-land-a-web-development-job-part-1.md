You've invested hours learning syntax, debugging errors, creating projects, creating your resume and now you're ready to get paid.

There are alot of online articles, twitter posts and discord groups created on the topic and there is one common theme. Getting your first job is difficult. There really is no way around that, but I have a tangible path you can take to alleviate some of the pain, but it will come at a cost and could (probably will) set you back in the long run.

### The path of least resistence

The easiest way to get your first developer job is to apply to small companies. I'm not talking about tech start-ups, I'm talking about the local Ford (or GM and Chrylser for the gearheads) dealerships, your friend's mom's consulting business or the local flower shop. Almost every business has a web presence and they will need someone to maintain their site.

You will probably be working with static websites or content management systems such as Wordpress and Shopify to manage content. The interesting thing about small companies is that you may be required to do a lot more than just manage content. Depending on the company, you might be responsible for other responsibilities such as setting up new domains, server migrations (not as difficult as it sounds), or even helping the owners' sister who can't seem to turn on her laptop.

#### What to do before applying
The most important thing to have is a portfolio. If you can't show what you've done, you won't get hired. Anywhere. Ever. Spend the $10 to buy yourself a domain name and setup your portfolio site. Don't worry about trying to come up with some beautiful design. You're a developer, not a designer (unless you are. In that case, have at it). There are beautiful templates that you can modify and make your own.

Fill your portfolio with actual websites you've built. In a lot of online courses, you might build small applications such as a calculator or a todo list. Those are cute and a great way to build confidence and understanding but they're pretty meaningless for our goal here. If the new employer needs you to showcase a new car in a hero section, I don't think he's going to care about that game of tic-tac-toe.

The best way to go about building an actual portfolio is by securing a couple clients and building websites for them. Overheard you uncle talking about starting a new landscaping business? Offer to build the website. Noticed that your favorite local resturant's website isn't responsive? Rebuild the site and show them how their current website could be improved. Do whatever it takes to get some actual experience.

On the flip side, maybe your not social enough to land clients or you just don't feel comfortable with the earlier approach? Think of an idea of a business (Name, Brand, products etc) and create a website based around that. As an example, here is one of the first ideas I came up with [Karate in the garage](https://flamboyant-lovelace-10ee72.netlify.com/). On reflection the concept is pretty sad, but it's not about the business, it's just about showcasing your ability to create a website. That's all we're after here.



#### The interview process
The interview process will be different for each company, but chances are it will be way less rigorus than at an actual tech company. There probably won't be any ridiculous whiteboarding interviews or a 3 to 4 interview process. When I landed my first development job, my first interview lasted all of 5 minutes. I received a take home project which consisted of replicating a static website. After submitting that, I had a second interview which consisted of speaking with the owner of the company about his vision for the company, and that was it.


#### The danger
If you have dreams of creating cool applications or working for Google/Amazon/Facebook etc, this isn't it. Let's not kid ourselves. 

Chances are you will probably be the only developer. There might be another guy who edited a Myspace page years ago and has been running the web department for the company since then, but that will probably be it. There will be no code reviews, pair-programming, github, or even a development methodology. Since you'll be dealing with content management systems, you probably won't be writing actual code everyday. Also, there's no quality assurance department. Actually, *you* are the quailty assurance department.

There will probably also be an issue with pay. Oh, you've read about all those developers getting paid $100,000 a year to start? Sorry, that's not happening for you. Not right now anyway. You'll be lucky to make $40,000 (depending on location of course!).

The true danger is in this role lies in routine. You're no longer working at the job you hated. You are now in the industry and probably doing very easy tasks that you complete with your eyes closed. Now, if you don't want anything more than this, you've made it! Congrats on doing the work and becoming an employed developer! 

If you do want something more than this, then you can't stop learning (actually, you can never stop learning in this field). There's no time to pat yourself on the back, the work has just begun. Once you feel comfortable, get with the other developer (or do it yourself) and try to start using modern development practices. Implement code reviews, start using github or some other source of version control and also throw in some software development methodology. Why is all this necessary you ask? Simply put, you won't go to "the next level" without having experience with these tools. When you start applying to tech companies and you don't have experience with those techonologies, chances are you're not going to get the job. 


#### Who should take this path?
This path is probably best for people who are looking to make a career change and want to leave their current job ASAP. It's a great way to get employed without having deep knowledge of data structures & algorithms or even people who aren't great with using JavaScript. If you know how to build a website, you can find a job.
